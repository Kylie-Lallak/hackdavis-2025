# Important Note Regarding GitHub Contributions

As a solo participant in hackDavis, I encountered an issue with the GitHub repository attribution. After my laptop was damaged, I used a friend's machine to continue working on the project. While I was logged into my own GitHub account, GitHub mistakenly attributed the repository to my friend's account due to an email stored locally on their machine.

Initially, this caused it to show **two contributors**. However, if you click on the "Contributors" section, you will notice that **no other contributor is listed**. Additionally, if you examine the commit history, you will see that **I am the only one who has made any commits**, and no one else has had access to the GitHub repository.

This attribution error was caused by GitHub, but I want to make it clear that **I am the sole contributor to this project**.

Thank you for your understanding.
